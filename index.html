        <h1>Welcome to my Site!</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 12pt">This is Detonation Blog 2.0! It's a place for me to share interesting stuff, my hobbies, and my music. I've been toying with the design of this site for some time now and I've settled on this. The site has been redesigned using Bootstrap instead of jQuery Mobile so you'll find a responsive theme throughout on either mobile or desktop.</p>

          <h2>A day using Salesforce Communities</h2>
          <p>Posted on December 21, 2013</p>
          <p>Communities are branded spaces for your employees, customers, and partners to connect. You can customize and create communities to meet your business needs, then transition seamlessly between them. Communities are a great way to share information and collaborate with people outside your company who are key to your business processes, such as customers or partners.</span></p>

          <h2>Using Google Apps Scripts to auto translate text</h2>
          <p>Posted on December 20, 2013</p>
          <p>Tuesday in class we went over the uses of Google App Scripts. I gotta say I didn't think it would be all that great, but after using it I saw how useful it could be. Tim showed us how you can take a script and turn it into a polling service that populates a Google spreadsheet. The question was who would win the final four in NCAA. All we had to do was text our pick (A-D) to his phone number and it populated on the spreadsheet, pretty easy.</p>

          <p>Posted on June 12, 2013</p>
          <p>Think your version of Windows is corrupt? Have you been seeing error messages referencing .dll files? 
          Having problems using Windows in general? A quick way to see if your operating system is corrupt or missing important files is to use system file checker to verify the integrity of Windows' files.</p>

          <h2>How to bring back the Windows 7 Start Menu in Windows 8</h2>
          <p>Posted on January 24, 2013</p>
          <p>As requested here are some programs that will allow you to bring back that old start menu if you'd rather use that. The one I think had the best interface is <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Start8/3000-2072_4-75732532.html" target="_blank">Start8</a>, it's free to try for 30 days and is only $4.99 to buy (not bad if you hate the new menu). Start8 matches the look and feel of Windows 8. <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/9-windows-start-menus-windows-8-208963?page=0,0" target="_blank">Here</a> are also a few more I found that are pretty cool looking.</p>

It talks about this new web app that has come out that allows you to connect to peoples insecure webcams and look through them.</p>
