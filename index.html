          <h2>Using Google Apps Scripts to auto translate text</h2>
          <p>Posted on December 20, 2013</p>
          <p>Tuesday in class we went over the uses of Google App Scripts. I gotta say I didn't think it would be all that great, but after using it I saw how useful it could be. Tim showed us how you can take a script and turn it into a polling service that populates a Google spreadsheet. The question was who would win the final four in NCAA. All we had to do was text our pick (A-D) to his phone number and it populated on the spreadsheet, pretty easy.</p>

          <p>After that, we were on our own to read through an in class assignment that allowed us to create a few scripts for reading current stock prices, text messaging, and translating English text to any language we want using Google Translate.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="posts/translate.png" width="500px" />

          <p>It's very easy to do once you get the script written out. Doing that is a little tricky, it's like the VBA language. Overall it's a useful service that I didn't know existed and it shows how easy technology is integrating services together.</p>

        <!-- Windows SFC Post
      =============================================== -->
        <p>
          <h2>Windows giving you error messages? Check to see if it's corrupt</h2>
          <p>Posted on June 12, 2013</p>
          <p>Think your version of Windows is corrupt? Have you been seeing error messages referencing .dll files? 
          Having problems using Windows in general? A quick way to see if your operating system is corrupt or missing important files is to use system file checker to verify the integrity of Windows' files. To do this, click start and type 'cmd.' When the cmd shortcut comes up, right-click on it and select "Run as Administrator." When the command line opens up type in "sfc /scannow."</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="posts/cmdsfc.png" width="450px" />

          <p>This command will have Windows scan all OS files and verify their accuracy with a list of all the files it should have in the system. If it finds any integrity violations, it tries to repair them. If however windows cannot repair the files, it will let you know, and if you are running Windows XP it will actually ask you for the OS disc that was shipped with your machine and will attempt to copy the missing .dll files from it. If you're using Vista and up, you'll have to resort to re-installing the OS.. on the bright side, you'll have a fresh out-of-the-box machine when you're all done.</p>

          <p>Posted on January 24, 2013</p>
          <p>As requested here are some programs that will allow you to bring back that old start menu if you'd rather use that. The one I think had the best interface is <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Start8/3000-2072_4-75732532.html" target="_blank">Start8</a>, it's free to try for 30 days and is only $4.99 to buy (not bad if you hate the new menu). Start8 matches the look and feel of Windows 8. </p>

          <h2>Want to spy on people through their webcams?</h2>
          <p>Posted on January 22, 2013</p>
          <p>Perusing the internet today I came across <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5977915/this-interactive-map-lets-you-spy-on-insecure-webcam-feeds" target="_blank">this article</a>. It talks about this new web app that has come out that allows you to connect to peoples insecure webcams and look through them. I'm currently in the CIS 394 class on Privacy and this was especially intriguing to me. Apparently there is a security flaw in some Trendnet home security cameras that allows you to do this and the web app was created to showcase this flaw so it will be brought to the attention of the public. The app even uses Google Maps to show you where the person is located in the world (surprisingly accurate).</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="posts/ku-xlarge.png" />

          <p>Trendnet has notified its customers about the flaw and has sent a firmware update (although not everyone has installed it!) to fix the problem. I find this very shocking, and hope that these kinds of security flaws don't extend to other types of cameras like laptop webcams, or smart phones… Interesting article nonetheless.</p>

        <p>
          <h2>Using IFTTT and Zapier</h2>
          <p>Posted on January 15, 2013</p>
          <p>I've been using Zapier and IFTTT for the last few days and I have to say, I'm really making the web work for me. I've set up a few different automated tasks that help me in my day to day life. One commonly used one is for the weather. If it's going to rain tomorrow, IFTTT sends me a text telling me to "Bring an umbrella!", and lets me know what the forecast is, very useful.</p>

          <p>Next I moved onto a more job based task with Zapier. On the weekends I'm a computer technician for Staples and we work with a lot of PCs at a time, a lot of which are running the new Windows OS. So keeping up with Windows 8 is a must for us to learn the ins and outs of the new system and keep track of all the changes over Windows 7. My Zap allows me to search RSS feeds to look for “Windows 8″ and forward the links to my phone via sms based on what RSS feeds I give it. This is very useful to never miss a posting, and keeps me sharp on new topics and workarounds for common issues with upgrading to the new system.</p>

          <p>I've also set a Zap up to email me a link when a new YouTube video is posted by a certain username which helps me keep up with my favorite subscriptions. This synergy of applications is certainly useful for everyday automation and requires little knowledge of coding or application design to use allowing anyone to make their accounts work together for them.</p>
