###What is it?

Detonation blog is just a personal site that I've been working on the past few years. It's sort of a hub for my professonal information, resume, and digital portfolio. I'ts main page is the blog part where I post mostly tech information but would like to get into posting some different types of articles. You can also watch my YouTube Guitar covers and listen to my original recordings. That's about it. Go check it out.
