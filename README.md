DETONATION<b>BLOG</b><br />
by Mathew Ruff


####What is it?

Detonation blog is just a personal site that I've been working on the past few years. It's gone through many changes over the past couple years and has become a sort of hub for my professonal information, resume, and digital portfolio. It's main page is the blog part where I post mostly tech information but would like to get into posting some different types of articles. You can also visit the music page to watch my YouTube Guitar covers and listen to my original recordings. Theres a page for my resume and digital portfolio as well. That's about it. Go check it out.
