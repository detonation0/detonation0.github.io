			<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Introduction to Communities (From Salesforce Documentation) - </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Watch a Demo: &nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="http://www.salesforce.com/_app/video/chatter/help/Salesforce_Communities_Setup_video.jsp">Setting Up Your Salesforce Community</a></span><span>&nbsp;(5:59 minutes)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Communities are branded spaces for your employees, customers, and partners to connect. You can customize and create</span></p><p class="c0"><span>communities to meet your business needs, then transition seamlessly between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Communities are a great way to share information and collaborate with people outside your company who are key to your business processes, such as customers or partners.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You can use Communities to:</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; Drive more sales by connecting your employees with your distributors, resellers, and suppliers</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; Deliver world-class service by giving your customers one place to get answers</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&bull; Manage social listening, content, engagement, and workflow all in one place</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You can create multiple communities within your organization for different purposes. For example, you could create a customer support community to reduce support costs, or a channel sales community for partner deal support, or you could have a community specifically dedicated to an upcoming event.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Communities may contain a subset of features and data available in your internal Salesforce organization and can be customized to use your company branding. In addition, you can choose which members from your company and which customers, partners, or other people outside your company can join.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Communities live inside your organization and are easily accessed from a drop-down menu in the top left corner of Salesforce. Use this menu to switch between your communities and your internal Salesforce organization.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><img height="233" src="images/image07.png" width="492"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Built-in Salesforce Community with Tabs - </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Creating a Salesforce community within Salesforce is very straightforward. It gives you the ability to Name the community, restrict users/members, add styling and logos to your page, and access other tabs/app from salesforce on the same page. </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To create a community this way, you first need to have a Force.com Site built (a domain available) for the community. Once you do that all you have to do is go to Setup &gt; Customize &gt; Communities. Select the link for Create and Manage Communities. </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="70" src="images/image02.png" width="624"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Fill out all the required fields for naming the community and choosing the domain. It will prompt you that once you do this, a &ldquo;Global Header&rdquo; will be enabled for all users and that you can&rsquo;t go back. The Global Header will allow you to quickly switch between your Salesforce dashboard and the Community you are about to create. The global header will look like this:</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="70" src="images/image04.png" width="624"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The setup link moves to the right side drop-down menu below your name, while the ability to switch between the community and the dashboard moves to the left side drop-down menu. Once the community is created, you can go back to Create and Manage Communities and click edit next to the name of your Community. This menu allows you to customize the colors of the links, header, background, etc. as well as lets you upload your company logo and change the text for the login screen. </span></p><p class="c0"><img height="273" src="images/image03.png" width="419"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You can also add custom tabs to the community to access your Salesforce information from within it. These tabs are the same ones from your apps on the Salesforce dashboard. Once you finish applying your changes your community looks like this:</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="224" src="images/image00.png" width="624"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You&rsquo;ll have access to your community chatter feed, profile, followers, topics, files, groups, etc. You can see I added the tab for MyASU, which is a web tab that shows my.asu.edu in the tab window. This implementation of communities is great because you have access to all the apps and objects from salesforce without the know-how and limitations of coding it with apex.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"><br></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Salesforce Community Built with Visualforce Pages - </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>You can also build a community from scratch using Apex and Visualforce. The only downside to this is you have to grab each item manually and it&rsquo;s limited to what information you can show on the page. You aren&rsquo;t able to show tabs, but you can create custom controllers for you objects and pull the info onto the page. Styling also has to be created manually and uploaded to static resources within Salesforce. Here I&rsquo;ve created a very standard Visualforce page pulling the chatter feed and follows onto the page:</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="423" src="images/image05.png" width="575"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I&rsquo;ve added my own .css files to Salesforce to get the look and feel of asu.edu:</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="268" src="images/image08.png" width="492"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Again the data that can be displayed is restricted compared to the standard community, but you can get a standard feed/conversation going within Visualforce. Another downside is that the feed displayed for the custom visualforce page is different from the community feed created through Salesforce, as of now I can&rsquo;t find a way to display the community feed. </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Chatter Community Answers - </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Communities also have a nice feature called Answers which allow users to search for questions and find answers to them. If a question doesn&rsquo;t exist the user has the ability to post the question to the community to be answered. Users can vote on answers to chose the best answer to the question and have the ability to comment on the users answers. </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="533" src="images/image01.png" width="624"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Answers Visualforce Page - </span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Once you enable answers for your community, Salesforce will auto-generate visualforce pages for you. After editing the main page you can get something like this:</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><img height="334" src="images/image06.png" width="624"></p><p class="c1 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Here is an example from Akami of using community answers from force.com:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://myakamai.force.com/?feedtype=RECENT&amp;dc=All&amp;criteria=ALLQUESTIONS">Akami</a></span></p>
