        <img src="images/me2.jpg" alt="me" style="padding-right:20px" width="150px" align="left"/>
        <p>This site was developed initially as a class assignment that challenged the students to create a Windows Azure
          Virtual Machine and host a website out of it. Since then, the site has been used for personal use. You will find
          links to my music, as well as technology and interesting information on the posts page.</p>
          
        <p>I've really enjoyed developing this site. It's become a fun project that I didn't think would evolve beyond
        a class assignment into something I can actually put out here on the web. I love to learn and I'm always looking for
        the next big thing to learn about and implement into my work. I'm going to keep improving the site beyond
        what you might see currently, adding more and more content whenever possible.</p>
