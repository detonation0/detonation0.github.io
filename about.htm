        <p>This site was developed initially as a class assignment that challenged the students to create a Windows Azure Virtual Machine and host a website out of it. Since then, the site has been used for my personal use. Here you will find links to my original music as well as technology and interesting information on the posts page.</p>
          
        <p>I've really enjoyed developing this site, it's become a fun project that I didn't think would evolve beyond
        a class assignment into something I can actually put out here on the web. I love to learn and I'm always looking for the newest technology to perfect and implement into my work. I'm going to keep improving the site beyond what you might see currently, adding more and more content whenever possible.</p>
